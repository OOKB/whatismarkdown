Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which can then be easily converted to HTML in CAPE documents.

Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a tool that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. As a user of Markdown within the CAPE ecosystem, you only need to be worried about #(1).

The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. The single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

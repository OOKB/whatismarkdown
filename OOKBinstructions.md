Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which can then be easily converted to HTML in CAPE documents.

Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a tool that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. As a user of Markdown within the CAPE ecosystem, you only need to be worried about #(1).

The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. The single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

# A Markdown Style Guide:

## Paragraphs.
A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

## Headlines.

# Headline1
## Headline2 (Subhead1)
### Headline3 (Subhead2)
#### Headline4 (Subhead3)
##### Headline5 (Subhead4)
###### Headline6 (Subhead5)

## Lists.
To make a list, start each line with a dash and then a space.

- Item One
- Item Two
- Item Three.

For numbered lists, start each line with a number, a period, and then a space.

1. First Thing
2. Second Thing
3. Third Thing.

## Bold/Italics.
To make a word within a sentence **bold**, surround it with two asterisks like **this**.

To make a word *italic*, surround it with one asterisk like *this*.
